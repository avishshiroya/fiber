//                     "reasoning": "\n\nAlright, so I just got this query where the user is asking me to create a recipe using specific JSON data they provided. Let me try to untangle this.\n\nFirst, they mentioned a JSON structure with fields like Ingredients, NutritionalInfo, Notes, and Request. It looks like they want me to parse this data and generate a recipe response in a specific format they provided as a model. The model includes recipe name, ingredients required, nutritional info, cooking time, and instructions.\n\nOkay, so the user's request isn't just about generating a recipe; they're probably integrating this into an application. Maybe they're building a meal planning app or something where users input ingredients and get a recipe back. The structure they provided has fields that are typically needed for that—ingredients, nutritional information, and so on.\n\nI need to make sure I understand exactly which JSON fields they're providing. The Ingredients are an array of strings, which is straightforward. NutritionalInfo is another struct with calories, carbs, fat, and protein—so that maps directly to the nutritional info in the response. The Notes and Request fields are strings, which might be used for additional instructions or specific requests from the user.\n\nLooking at the example response they provided, it's quite detailed. They have a recipe name, list of ingredients, nutritional info broken down, cooking time, and step-by-step instructions. So, I need to ensure that my generated response includes all these elements accurately.\n\nI wonder if the Ingredients they provide are already in a specific order or if I need to organize them. In the example, the ingredients are listed in a logical order starting with the base (lentils) and moving to vegetables and seasonings. Maybe I should follow that structure to make it more coherent.\n\nThe nutritional info in their example is per serving, so I should keep that in mind. I'll need to calculate or estimate the values based on the ingredients provided. If the user gives specific values, great, but if not, I might have to make educated guesses or prompt them for more details.\n\nCooking time is another important factor. They specified 25 minutes in the example. I need to ensure that the cooking time I provide is reasonable for the recipe I'm generating. If they're asking for a quick meal, 25 minutes is good, but for something more elaborate, it might be longer.\n\nThe instructions in the example are concise but clear. They walk through each step from cooking the main ingredient to preparing the sides and combining everything. I should follow this approach—simple, step-by-step instructions that a home cook can follow without confusion.\n\nNow, thinking about possible edge cases: what if the user provides ingredients that are uncommon or require specific preparation? I'd need to handle that gracefully, maybe by suggesting substitutions or additional steps. Also, if the nutritional info isn't provided, I might need to calculate it based on standard values for each ingredient.\n\nAnother thing is the Recipe Name. In the example, it's creative and descriptive—\"Spicy Lentil Veggie Bowl.\" I should aim for something catchy yet informative. Maybe include the main ingredient and a hint about the flavor profile or the type of dish.\n\nLet me also consider the structure for NutritionalInfo. It has calories, carbs, fat, and protein. I need to make sure these are accurate and perhaps note if they're per serving or for the entire recipe. In the example, it's likely per serving, so I'll have to be clear about that.\n\nI also notice that the response includes cooking time in minutes. I should ensure that this is practical and matches the instructions. For example, if a recipe requires simmering for 20 minutes, the cooking time should reflect that.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to take the JSON data, parse it, and map each field correctly to the response structure. I'll start with the recipe name based on the ingredients and request notes. Then list the ingredients, making sure they're relevant and in a sensible order. Next, calculate or extract the nutritional info. Then, estimate the cooking time based on the steps involved, and finally, write clear instructions that guide the user through each step.\n\nI also need to make sure that the JSON structure provided by the user is correctly unmarshalled into the appropriate Go structs, as indicated by the \"json\" tags. So, the Ingredients are a slice of strings, NutritionalInfo is another struct, etc. Handling this correctly in the backend will be crucial for the app to function properly.\n\nTesting the response format is essential too. I should make sure that all the fields are present and correctly formatted, avoiding any missing or misplaced data. Maybe after generating the response, I can validate it against the model to ensure consistency.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are: parse the input JSON, extract the necessary fields, generate each part of the response (recipe name, ingredients, nutritional info, cooking time, instructions), ensuring that each part is accurate and well-formatted. I should also consider possible variations and edge cases to make the response robust and user-friendly.\n",
